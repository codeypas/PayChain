cd paychain/truffle
truffle migrate --network development
```
Check the deployment output for the contract address.

### Using Truffle Console:
```bash
truffle console --network development
let instance = await PayrollSystem.deployed()
instance.address
```

### From Ganache UI:
1. Open Ganache
2. Navigate to "Contracts" tab
3. Find `PayrollSystem` contract
4. Copy the displayed contract address

## Connecting MetaMask to Ganache

### Step 1: Install MetaMask

2. Install the extension
3. Create a new wallet

### Step 2: Add Ganache as a Network in MetaMask

3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Network Name:** `Ganache Local`
   - **New RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - **Chain ID:** `1337`
   - **Currency Symbol:** `ETH`
4. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Import a Ganache Account to MetaMask

## Testing the Connection

### Start your backend server:
```bash
cd paychain/server
npm run dev
```

cd paychain/client
npm start
```

### Open the app and test transactions:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Not Connecting
- Ensure Ganache is running
- Verify MetaMask network settings
- Reset MetaMask (Settings > Advanced > Reset Account)

### Contract Not Found
- Verify contract address in frontend/backend
- Ensure contract is deployed to Ganache

### Transaction Errors
- Ensure sufficient ETH balance
- Use the correct account for operations

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and test PayChain locally before deploying to a testnet or mainnet.
